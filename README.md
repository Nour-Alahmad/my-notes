# Task Day2
## Introdiction 
My name is **Nour Amer Al-Ahmad**
I am currently a Software Engineering student at **LTUC**,  I am expected to graduate this summer. I live in Amman, but it is a bit far from the college. I started using _Windows 10 Pro_ when I enrolled as a Software Engineering
 actually, my study at LTUC was my beginning in the world of IT and programming, and I want to develop myself more and more in this field and become a professional programmer so that I can travel to the UAE to work there with one of my relatives, and I also want to enter the world of IoT after that and to continue to learn more and expand more
I am looking forward to having a great time with you with a lot of experience, knowledge, and new skills in this course **^^**
